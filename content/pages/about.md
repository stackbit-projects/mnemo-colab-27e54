      Colaboratory, or “Colab” for short, is a product from Google Research.
      Colab allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through
      the browser, and is especially well suited to machine learning, data
      analysis and education. More technically, Colab is a hosted Jupyter
      notebook service that requires no setup to use, while providing free
      access to computing resources including GPUs.
